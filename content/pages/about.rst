I'm a first year PhD student at Cardiff University School of Mathematics.
My research is in the field of Deep Learning, specifically looking at how Neural Networks can be used to analyse `PET Scans`_ in order to locate lung cancers more accurately.

I am massively interested in several different subject areas including (but most certainly not limited to): Crypto Currencies, Maths, Python, Machine Learning. I particularly enjoy projects that let me combine these interests.


What is the counter at the bottom of the page?
----------------------------------------------

You may have heard of Bitcoin Mining, the process of using your computers processing power to generate digital money.
The small counter you see at the bottom of the pages is doing exactly that. It runs unobtrusively (you won't see any drop in performance from your computer) and helps me keep this blog completely add free. However, if you strongly disagree with this idea the miner can be stopped at any time by just clicking on it.
